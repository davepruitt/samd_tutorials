# Tutorials/example code for SAMD21 and SAMD51 microcontrollers

Let's face it: the documentation from Microchip/Atmel is pretty bad, and it can take forever to figure out how to do fairly simple tasks.

Having slugged through many frustrating days of trying to figure out how to do some things, I decided to create some example code/tutorials in the hope that it may help others to figure things out as well.

My code is certainly not perfect nor bug free, but it should work and help to get some simple things up and running. You can take it and perfect it for your application.
